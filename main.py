# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
number1=4
number2=4
print(number1+number2)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
number1=4
number2=2
print(number1/number2)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
number1=10
number2=5
print(number1*number2)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length=20
print(length)
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width=1
print(width)
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area=length*width
print(area)
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print("the result is, {area}")
# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
length = 5
width = 3
print(f"if the length of a rectangle is {length} and the width is {width} then the area is {length*width} ")
